      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Season chicken with
        seasoned salt and pepper, add to the pot, and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and cook until almost translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic
        and cook until slightly browned, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in broth, water, potatoes, carrots, and celery; cook until potatoes
        and carrots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning
        with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
